This is a project for the distributed systems course i took at uniMib

It's supposed to be a mock banking system with a rest api, relational database
and web application.

I decided to implement it using the following technologies

- **web**: Svelte.js framework with vite.js as bundler and devserver. Nginx as production server
- **api**: Python, with FastAPI
- **database**: Mariadb
